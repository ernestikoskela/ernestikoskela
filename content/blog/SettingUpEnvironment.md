Hi.

I'm new here.

My tools for web publishing and development

- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io)
- [Github](https://github.com/ernestikoskela)
- [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/)

This combination has some unique workflow perks.

- Emacs+Tmux friendly. Every save renders page automatically to browser for a quick check.
- Cloudflare pages are free with sane limitations. If you don't need more than 15K of pages or gigabytes of space, it really is free as a beer.
- Continuous Integration. When you are ready to commit, just git push to Github and Cloudflare will fetch your commits and rebuilds.

I haven't figured out yet how to do effective spellcheck (Flyspell works, but suggestions are too cumbersome to use), but that's task for another day.
